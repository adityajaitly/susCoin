# susCoin Pitch Script (3 Minutes)

## ðŸ”¹ Opening Hook (0:00 â€“ 0:20)
"Cities are the beating heart of culture, innovation, and connection. But as they grow, they face urgent challenges: climate change, resource scarcity, and the evolving nature of work. The question is: how can we design tools that help cities thrive sustainably? Our answer is susCoin."

## ðŸ”¹ The Problem (0:20 â€“ 0:40)
"Today, sustainable choices are invisible and unrewarded. People want to act, but incentives are weak. Governments and companies want to encourage change, but lack systems to track and reward it. The loop between good intentions and measurable impact is broken."

## ðŸ”¹ The Solution (0:40 â€“ 1:10)
"susCoin is a rewards layer for sustainable living.
â€¢ Take the bus instead of driving â†’ earn susCoins.
â€¢ Reduce household electricity use â†’ earn susCoins.
â€¢ Install solar panels â†’ earn monthly susCoins.
These coins can be redeemed for real-world rewards like food, fuel credits, or discounts at local businesses. At the same time, governments and companies receive verified COâ‚‚ reduction data and can run targeted incentive programs."

## ðŸ”¹ Addressing the Hackathon Challenges (1:10 â€“ 1:30)
"In short:
â€¢ We reimagine infrastructure by turning transport and utilities into reward engines.
â€¢ We optimise resources by incentivising efficient use of electricity, water, and waste.
â€¢ We support diverse industries by rewarding gig workers and remote employees through tailored programs.
susCoin answers all three challenge areas."

## ðŸ”¹ Demo Walkthrough (1:30 â€“ 2:30)
"Here's how it works in practice:

**1. User Dashboard** â€” Personalized dashboards for students and professionals with tailored suggestions and carbon impact tracking.

**2. Transport Scoring** â€” Users calculate emissions for any journey from point A to B, with automatic COâ‚‚ comparison and susCoin rewards.

**3. Opal Card Integration** â€” Connect your Opal card for automatic public transport tracking and rewards.

**7. Carbon Calculator** â€” Interactive tools for journey planning and impact assessment.

**8. Mastercard Integration** â€” Cash out susCoins directly to your bank account.

This shows the full loop: action â†’ verification â†’ reward â†’ redemption â†’ impact."

## ðŸ”¹ Closing & Next Steps (2:30 â€“ 3:00)
"susCoin creates a circular green economy: citizens save money, businesses gain customers, and cities gain measurable climate impact.

Next, we'll expand verification with APIs like Strava, smart meters, and transport data; launch a mobile app; and pilot with councils and businesses.

With susCoin, every sustainable choice â€” every ride, every watt saved, every panel installed â€” pays off. For people, for businesses, and for the cities of the future."
